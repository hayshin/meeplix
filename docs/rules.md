# Frontend
You're empDesign a modern, AI-enhanced user interface for an online board game inspired by Dixit. The interface should be visually stunning, with a balance of futuristic high-tech elements and fantasy aesthetics.

## Core Visual Themes:
– Vivid color palette (purples, pinks, blues, shimmering gradients)
– Fantasy illustration-inspired textures, AI-generated surreal art as cards
– Animations are like in a game

## Game Elements:
– A card-based central gameboard showing 6 cards at a time
– Player avatars with whimsical or abstract fantasy profiles
– Space for AI-generated prompts, votes, and card descriptions
– Room/lobby screen with sci-fi fantasy theme (e.g. floating island, glowing server-core, magical portal)

## UX Focus:
– Clean, uncluttered layout
– Minimalist controls with tooltips
– Responsive design with tablet/desktop in mind
– Encourages player focus on cards and storytelling
– Localization and internationalization using Paraglide
- Contrast buttons

## Tone:
– Playful, original, curious
– But with a sleek futuristic polish to reflect the AI innovation

## Inspiration Sources:
– Dixit, Board Games, Gradients,

## Tech stack:
- SvelteKit as the frontend framework
- TailwindCSS for stylesheets
- BitsUI as component library
- Paraglide for localization and internationalization

# Backend
You're emphasizing type-safety and clean design. The backend must follow clean architecture principles, fully typed request/response logic, and be modular.

## Tech stack:
- ElysiaJS as the backend framework
- Eden for end-to-end type-safe client-server communication
- Typebox for input/output validation schemas
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL for database models and queries
